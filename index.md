## Macroecology & Macroevolution

_'In nature nothing exists alone' -Rachel Carson_ 

Nature on Earth is complex and originated from several processes. Therefore, there is no simple approach to understand how life evolved and is distributed on the planet.

As a scientist, I have been interested in different topics (natural history, behaviour, evolution, ecology). Hence, my research incorporates diverse techniques and data to answer questions about the origins of biological diversity at large temporal and spatial scales.
